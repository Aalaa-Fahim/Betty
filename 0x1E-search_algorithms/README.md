# Search Algorithms Practice in C

This repository serves as a practice ground for learning and implementing various search algorithms in the C programming language. Below are the key concepts covered in this repository:

1. **Search Algorithms**: Learn about different search algorithms used to find specific items or values within a collection of data.

2. **Linear Search**: Understand the linear search algorithm, also known as sequential search, which checks each element in a collection one by one until the target item is found.

3. **Binary Search**: Explore the binary search algorithm, a more efficient approach used on sorted collections, which divides the search interval in half at each step.

4. **Practical Examples in C**: Practice implementing linear search and binary search algorithms with examples written in the C programming language.

5. **Choosing the Best Algorithm**: Gain insights into selecting the most appropriate search algorithm based on factors such as collection size, data sorting, and specific search requirements.

This repository provides hands-on exercises and examples to help you understand and practice search algorithms in C.
